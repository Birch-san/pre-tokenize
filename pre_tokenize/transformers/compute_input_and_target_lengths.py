    """This function is copy of `random_spans_helper <https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer/blob/84f8bcc14b5f2c03de51bd3587609ba8f6bbd1cd/t5/data/preprocessors.py#L2466>`__ .

    Training parameters to avoid padding with random_spans_noise_mask.
    When training a model with random_spans_noise_mask, we would like to set the other
    training hyperparmeters in a way that avoids padding.
    This function helps us compute these hyperparameters.
    We assume that each noise span in the input is replaced by extra_tokens_per_span_inputs sentinel tokens,
    and each non-noise span in the targets is replaced by extra_tokens_per_span_targets sentinel tokens.
    This function tells us the required number of tokens in the raw example (for split_tokens())
    as well as the length of the encoded targets. Note that this function assumes
    the inputs and targets will have EOS appended and includes that in the reported length.

    Args:
        inputs_length: an integer - desired length of the tokenized inputs sequence
        noise_density: a float
        mean_noise_span_length: a float
    Returns:
        tokens_length: length of original text in tokens
        targets_length: an integer - length in tokens of encoded targets sequence

        # and one EOS token.
